### Crashes & Information

App crashes when running on iPhone 6, iPhone 5s, iPad Air, etc.

ARKit only works on devices with A9 chip or greater. So you need at least iPhone 6S or iPad with such a chip.

App runs, but nothing happens.

To play the game you need to find some horizontal surface: floor, table top, etc. Point you camera to a plane and move your device a little bit in different directions to force ARKit to find bounds of the plane. Once it will be found, you will see Tetris well on this plane.
